# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This is the final project for the third course in Coursera Data Science Specialization: Getting and Cleaning Data, offered by Johns Hopkins University. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

There are four files in this repository:
1. README.md (this file)
2. CodeBook.md, a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data
3. run_analysis.R, a R script that does the tasks described in the CodeBook.md
4. tidy_data.txt, a tidy data set generated by running the run_analysis.R
