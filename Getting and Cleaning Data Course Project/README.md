# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This is the final project for the third course in Coursera Data Science Specialization: Getting and Cleaning Data, offered by Johns Hopkins University. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

There are four files in this repository:
1. README.md (this file)
2. CodeBook.md, a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data
3. run_analysis.R, a R script that does the tasks described in the CodeBook.md
4. tidy_data.txt, a tidy data set generated by running the run_analysis.R

## About the data
### Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
